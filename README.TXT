Open favorite bash and :
make compile run

You don't want to play anymore :
make clean

I have to say minmax is still work in progress, and it now need a real graphical display.
You must play by respecting this syntax exclusively :

# 1 [                 ]
# 2 [                 ]
# 3 [                 ]
# 4 [       ● ◎       ]
# 5 [       ◎ ●       ]
# 6 [                 ]
# 7 [                 ]
# 8 [                 ]
#     A B C D E F G H 
# TURN BLACK
# TYPIN COORDINATES (a-z/1-26):
